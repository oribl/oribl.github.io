          <h3>2020</h3>
          <p>The project explores the process of creating in the digital 3d space and presents a unique physical interface 
            that enables intuitive sculpting of complex surfaces. CADmanship aims to be a tool that translates the mental intention and physical 
            action of creators, designers, architects, artists, and craftsmen to the digital realm</p>

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>There are 5 links controlling the curve, each connected to a potentiometer (4 in total). These links are attached to a linear potentiometer.</p>
        <p>By adjusting the links, the curve alters its shape, and by sliding the control, the curve changes its distance from the center.</p>
        <p>In the heart of the device lies a rotary encoder. Rotating it causes the curve to shift around the center.</p>
        <p>With this tool, users can manipulate both the curve and its position. By pressing a button, users can "freeze" the curve in space, 
          creating a loft surface between the curve and the subsequent one. After a few clicks, a complex 3D shape emerges.</p>

      <h1>Durable Prototype</h1>
      <p>While Prototype 1 performed adequately, its fragility was a concern. To ensure uninterrupted testing of the tool, I constructed a sturdier prototype.
      
      Around that time, I realized the importance of navigating within the 3D space with the tool.
      
      An additional button was incorporated, enabling a transition to navigation mode. In this mode, rotating the pivot causes the camera to orbit around the center, 
      while sliding the control adjusts the camera's vertical tilt.</p>

      <h1>Exploratory Phase</h1>
      <p>During this phase, I experimented with using the tool to "sketch" chairs. Through this process, 
        I grasped that the tool generates a distinct aesthetic language. Concurrently, I pondered the potential creative endeavors 
        of other users with the tool.</p>

    <h1>Collaboration with Ella</h1>
    <p>Ella Fischer Leventon, a student at the Glass and Ceramic Department at Bezalel Academy.</p>
    <p>I invited Ella to integrate the tool into the glass blowing process.</p>
    <p>Ella created two objects, which were 3D printed, used to make molds, and then used for glass blowing. The entire process is documented in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftq_VUujlr0&t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="primary-link">video</a>.</p>

  <h1>Collaboration with Shalom</h1>
  <p>Shalom Schwartz, responsible for the industrial design department workshops at Bezalel Academy.</p>
  <p>Shalom and I pondered the potential applications of this tool in the craftsmanship process. 
    We decided to test its capabilities by creating a mushroom.</p>
  <p>In this process, Shalom crafted the mushroom base through woodturning, while utilizing the tool to design the head. 
    The head was then CNC milled using a robotic arm. The entire process is showcased in this
