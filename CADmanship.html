          <h3>2020</h3>
          <p>The project explores the process of creating in the digital 3d space and presents a unique physical interface 
            that enables intuitive sculpting of complex surfaces. CADmanship aims to be a tool that translates the mental intention and physical 
            action of creators, designers, architects, artists, and craftsmen to the digital realm</p>

        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>There are 5 links controlling the curve, each connected to a potentiometer (4 in total). These links are attached to a linear potentiometer.</p>
        <p>By adjusting the links, the curve alters its shape, and by sliding the control, the curve changes its distance from the center.</p>
        <p>In the heart of the device lies a rotary encoder. Rotating it causes the curve to shift around the center.</p>
        <p>With this tool, users can manipulate both the curve and its position. By pressing a button, users can "freeze" the curve in space, 
          creating a loft surface between the curve and the subsequent one. After a few clicks, a complex 3D shape emerges.</p>

      <h1>Durable Prototype</h1>
      <p>While Prototype 1 performed adequately, its fragility was a concern. To ensure uninterrupted testing of the tool, I constructed a sturdier prototype.
      
      Around that time, I realized the importance of navigating within the 3D space with the tool.
      
      An additional button was incorporated, enabling a transition to navigation mode. In this mode, rotating the pivot causes the camera to orbit around the center, 
      while sliding the control adjusts the camera's vertical tilt.</p>

      <h1>Playing around</h1>
        <p>At that point I tried to "sketch" chairs with the tool. I understood during the process that the tool creates a specific aesthetic language. At the same time I was wondering what other creators will do with the tool.</p>

      <p>
      I asked Ella to include the tool in the glass blowing process. 
      
      Ella created 2 objects, 3D printed  them, made a mold out of them and blown glass into the molds - The whole process is shown in the

  <p>Shalom Schwartz - In charge of the industrial design department workshops at Bezalel academy.</p>

    <p>
      Shalom and I were thinking how this tool can be used in the process of a craftsman and chose to create this mushroom as a test case.

      In this process Shalom is woodturning the mushroom base, than designing the head using the tool and cnc milling it using a robotic arm - 
      The whole process is shown in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNQahIXrs8M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="primary-link">video</a>.
