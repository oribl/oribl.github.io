Bjorn Heinemann - R&D in packaging (focus on suistainable)
Jan-Hendrik Kaiser
Mathiide Van Rheenen - Material expert - working in the lab and make the tests like how much weight it can hold and how much moiusture it gets

Jan conntacted us.
they're the team that is looking for new packaging solution.
currently use EPS, etc...
looking to lower their carbon footprint and want to avoid plastic waste.
They found us and it looked interesting
a big challange is to replace EPS becasue they ship globally
want to get some samples and test it.
is it really sustainable, what are the properties?
what is the capacity we can produce at?
how much it cost? what is the timeline? are we a startup level?
How is it processed? how does it works?
they have big and heavy like luandry machines and light weight.
they will start small before getting to manufactering
asked about pyrolsis and humidity
do we have a life cycle assement? and do we have composting assesment?
asked about the surfaces? does it get scretchy? is it soft?
what density the EPS was that we were compering to? ***need to get back to Mathilde

questions:
are you manufacter the packaging by yourselfs? - mostly in germany but also poland and cezch and one in china
what kind of test are you doing? what kind of samples will you need (shapes, cuantites) - 1 squre meter at least 40cm. 5X5cm
how do you handle the end of life of the packaging currently? not really
